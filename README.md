Ant Blob Tracker
================

Introduction
------------
Visually tracks ants in video recordings over time and compile data regarding their interactions automatically.

This project was the result of an intensive 4 weeks of self-teaching while at Penn State University during the summer of 2012 after my junior year in high school.
Unfortunately, it was left partially incomplete due to my early departure from PSU. I've only recently uncovered these files. I updated the contents so they would compile in QT5, but functionality is limited. The code is here more as proof of concept than anything.

Built with QT4/5 and OpenCV.
